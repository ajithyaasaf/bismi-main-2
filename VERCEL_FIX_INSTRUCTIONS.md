# Fix for Vercel MIME Type Error

The "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of text/html" error occurs when Vercel serves JavaScript files with incorrect content types.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Update Your Vercel Project Settings

In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Build & Development Settings"
3. Set the build command to: `npm run build`
4. Set the output directory to: `dist/public`
5. Set the install command to: `npm install`

### 2. Add Environment Variables

In Vercel project settings, add these environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- `USE_FIRESTORE` = `true`
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` = `bismi-broilers-3ca96`

### 3. Deploy with the Updated Configuration

The updated `vercel.json` file should now correctly serve your static assets with proper MIME types.

## Alternative Solution: Use Vercel CLI

If the dashboard deployment still has issues:

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Login: `vercel login`
3. Deploy: `vercel --prod`

## Root Cause

The error happens when:
- Vercel's routing configuration incorrectly serves JavaScript files as HTML
- Static assets don't have proper content-type headers
- Build output structure doesn't match Vercel's expectations

## Verification

After deployment, your app should load without the MIME type error. The JavaScript modules will be served with `application/javascript` content type instead of `text/html`.

## If Issues Persist

1. Check Vercel build logs for any build failures
2. Verify that `dist/public/index.html` exists after build
3. Ensure JavaScript files are in `dist/public/assets/` directory
